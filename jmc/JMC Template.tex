\item DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET UNTIL YOU DECIDE TO BEGIN.
\item This is a twenty-five question multiple choice test. Each question is followed by answers marked A, B, C, D, and E. Only one of these is correct.
\item Mark your answer to each problem on the JMC {\contestNumber} Answer Form with a keyboard. Check the keys for accuracy and erase errors and stray marks completely.
\item You will receive 6 points for each correct answer, 1.5 points for each problem left unanswered, and 0 points for each incorrect answer.
\item No aids are permitted other than writing utensils, blank scratch paper, rulers, compasses, and erasers. No calculators, smartwatches, or computing devices are allowed. No problems on the test will require the use of a calculator.
\item Figures are not necessarily drawn to scale.
\item Before beginning the test, your non-existent proctor will not ask you to record certain information on the answer form. 
\item When you give the signal, begin working on the problems. You will have 75 minutes to complete the test. You can discuss only with people that have already taken the test in the private discussion forum until the end of the contest window.
\item When you finish the exam, don't sign your name in the space not provided on the Answer Form.
